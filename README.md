# ionic-s3-beanstalk
simple project developed to show how to handle a ionic app with communication with aws s3 and aws beanstalk using gitlab ci.

# project scope
In this moment i decided to public this base project to help others developers to configure a basic pipeline that can deploy a new version in aws elastic beanstalk, storing a new version in aws s3 bucket.

# elements to improve
If you see any improve that can help others to define a better pipeline feel free to make a PR.

# elements to consider
You need to configure a gitlab runner and register it to your (gitlab)repo to can execute the pipeline successfully.

# Notes
This project isn't a product, this means that maybe i can't fix the issues that you probably found, the correct way to improve this repo currently is with a PR, and with the help of everyone to keep this project working.

# why i don't have this repo on gitlab if use gitlab ci
I have some projects there but i'm trying to make this account, my main repositories account.
